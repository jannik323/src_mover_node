uhhmmm yea ,because i wasnt able to get around the cors error that id get if i run it in a browser.
As of now you just have to run the index.js with node and enter the things its asking for in the terminal.
If you have any improvements ( which wouldnt suprise me cause the code is dogshit lol ) , be sure to let me know or do a pull request.
